						<h5> What are the psychological affects on modern computer games on teenagers in an American society? </h5>
						<p>
						I have a theory based on the psychological impact of video games. This will be based on the age ranges between
13-23 years of age. I will be going in depth of that these videos may be cause behavioral problems. This paper is
based on a hypothesis that teenagers are both wasting their time for some false source of achievement instead
of working on their education or hobbies. I will be going through different titles below on my persuasion
techniques that game developers use to get you sucked into playing a video games. My prediction is that we are
being challenged by video games, it has been proven that they are changing all of us differently, improving
reaction time and making internet apart of everyone's life. I personally think that we are going to see a lot of
addictive attributes in people who do play video game. I think that people who play a lot of online multiplayer
games generally look for a false sense of achievement from video games. An example of this is the leveling
systems in the majority of MMO RPG video games. Before video game consoles really became popular at the
home, arcades was the most dominating thing in the gaming market. People and kids would swarm to a local
arcade to play video games. While doing this there was a huge social element in this. The majority of these
people would go to these arcades in a small group of friends in an attempt to knock someone off the scoreboards
and this is where it was also a challenge to get onto the top leader boards.
