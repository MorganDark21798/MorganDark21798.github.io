							<h4>Finally</h4>
<h5>Written 03/0618</h5>
<p>
Working on a few more hours each week now I finally have my contract upped so now I am technically a full time staff of Team Know How after my job change. So I am working on a few different things now I have a decent source of income, I will be working on getting a Patreon up and running for my website designs and star working more heavily on my portfolio. I am also writing a lot more notes than I have previously have so I do have a few hand written notes that I will be looking to publish. I am also soon going to be working on another template to add to the portfolio I am building, And also a
preview and download page on my website for all of the templates that I have created. This way some people will be able in order to actually play around with my designs.
</p>
<p>
So I am in the middle of typing up this blog post on my tablet due to the fact I am too lazy to actually get up and go over to my desk set up and turn on my compute, so thank god for cloud storage.
</p>
<p>
Looks like a few days away before the baby is born maybe a good idea, just to relax and not constantly working on things that only progress slowly anyway. I am going to spend a day or two down by the beach. Need to grab a few photos for some projects anyway. Two birds one stone they say.
</p>
<p>
Well I will post again in a few days...
