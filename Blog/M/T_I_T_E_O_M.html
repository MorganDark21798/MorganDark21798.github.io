                  So it has been a while since I have done one of these to be quite honest, but today was a pretty eventful day that I think that I can talk about with you guys. I woke up this morning to find that I got my pay in my bank, and if there is one thing you must know about me is that I am not a huge spender at all, I still have the majority of my last month’s pay. I decided to splurge a bit and go and get myself a awesome new tattoo and even a new laptop for my university course.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My tattoo I love! I wanted something unique on my arm to start off my sleeve and I don’t think that I could have picked a better design myself. This is not a tattoo that I got just for the sake of getting there is a bit of a story behind it. I used to stay over my great nans when I was little and she would look after me for most of the week, I mean she was amazing she loved spending time with me and my brother watching WWE even though I don’t think she liked the show herself she would sit through it to spend some time with us. She would try and find some entertaining things to do with us. One of her favourite things to do was watch some of the birds out in the garden. She would even teach me the different types of birds, so I made her a little gift which she could use in her back garden. It was a little bird house that she could fill up with seeds to spot more birds in her garden. I sort of remember that about her and after she passed away we was all devastated so I have now got a nice tattoo to remember my great nan by.

                  The next thing that I got today was a new laptop for my university work that I will be doing soon. I recently enrolled on my university course and am working at least in this photo on a new website to host all my programs and projects that I do. I will be starting my new year of university on the 25th of this month. I can honestly say that I am kind of excited to get back there. In terms of the laptop, I can say it is one of the best laptops that I have ever owned and it is amazing even though it is only a i3 7th gen processor. It is more than enough for me. I have been using this laptop for a couple of days now before college just set up all my file system for my course files. I am now looking at my website design projects and thinking of setting up my ideal work environment for optimal productivity. The only thing that I am missing is the fact I use to be running Linux rather than windows but all of my other computers are either based on Linux mint or elementary OS which are both amazing operating systems, but Windows 10 will be on the computers in my university. So, to keep a complete unified experience I will be keeping windows on here for the time being. I have added a few pieces of software that I need for college on this laptop though so a small list of software that is currently installed will be below.
                </p>
                <li>Opera:</li>
                <p>
                  I much prefer this over chrome due to the fact of the social implementation of my favourite applications like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger. I mean messenger I use personally to keep in touch with people but WhatsApp is what I use for work and need it always of the day.
                </p>
                <li>Office 365:</li>
                <p>
                  Need this for my university class. Will be using this to type up my assignments.
                </p>
                <li>Team know how cloud storage:</li>
                <p>
                  This is a amazing tool that basically the sort of cloud storage that I use on a day to day basis. It is a company that I currently work with that offer their 5year cloud which for the raw amount of storage that you get with it is amazing. I purchased this with the laptop and it is something like 90GBP for 2TB of storage for 5years. Enough said.
                </p>
                <li>Notepad++ & Atom.io:</li>
                <p>
                  Right I will talk about these two together because I basically use them for the same thing and that is some small coding projects. Last year I was making a password management tool in python. So when I was in college I had a small python program to run and get my randomly generated passwords and change them if needs be. Now this month I am working on a new website re-design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other than those pieces of software I do not use anything else so this is quite a light piece of work. Since I mainly will be writing up some assignments on this and editing some HTML and CSS scripts. I mean yeah, I could of got a small cheap HP and chucked a version of elementary OS on there and use that fine but I could not find one with the specifications that I wanted for a decent price. I was basically looking for a small compact machine with more than 2GB or ram and a SSD. That was all the specifications that I gave to the sales person who served me at my work in the computer store.
