						<h4>Linux</h4>
<h5>Written 20/06/18</h5>
<p>
	Looking at Linux mint 19, from the perspective of a long time fan of Linux mint distrobution and the over all base of the company that work out of a few offices based in london. algthough the design hasn't changed by much I do not see that as a bad thing I mean the main simple and straight forward design of this OS makes it the stable Distro that you would recomend to a family member or freind. I have found it to be a good starter into the wild and open source world of linux, and the layout of the desktop really offers that fermilular feeling for some people comming from Windows 7 or Windows XP even.
</p>
<p>
	This is the type of distro you can put on your nans laptop and mabye a month or two later when you check up on her it is still working as should.
</p>
<p>
	And that is what we want in some weird way, a simple os that will work in its current state for the forseable future. I mean I have been fixing laptops and desktops for about a year now both in work and out of work for family members, the amount of laptops that I have seen have had updates been pushed onto users and the over all breaking their laptop to the point they are not able to retreive their files without expert help is shocking. I have been activly recomending linux to my customer, family and freinds and have no issues with that.
</p>
<p>
	Now down to the distro...
This is a amazing distro to start off using linux with the over all layouyt of the desktop looking and feeling like Windows 7. Now in this release of linux mint they have fixed a few of their software, I will link their posts on a few of their changes below.
