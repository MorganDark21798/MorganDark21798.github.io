      <h3>Linux Mint, and why I am switching back.</h3>
      <h3>16/04/19</h3>
      <p>
      So, I want to get one thing off of my chest, This is not a full review of Linux Mint as a OS. This is more of me listing my reasons on why I am switching back to Linux as my Primary OS on my workhorse Laptop. I was using linux for a good year or two around two years ago. I even went so far as to post a few Distro reviews on both my personal website and on YouTubeâ€‹. Going back to the Linux Mint desktop for me at least feels like opening the front door to my childhood home. I feel a lot more productive and focus on this Dristro compared to Windows, because of the amount of hours I put in coding and writing on my laptop with Linux on there. I was always modifying and tweaking customization options with the desktop and also just doing the same thing with my personal website. I got so into it that I would like redesign my website every two months. I would create my website add all my content then get fed up wipe the slate clean and start again. I did all this before I even knew about things like BootStrap templates and things like that.

        So for me I am switching to Linux because that is where I feel more Productive. I would like to hear what OS you guys are using and why. Drop me a email.
