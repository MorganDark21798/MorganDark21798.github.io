      <h3>Moving Somthings Around</h3>
      <h3>30/03/19</h3>
      <p>
      Right I have been looking at the way I use my devices the last couple of days and thestructure that I set in place. I have noticed that it is not very secure and I am at risk of losingmy data if my hard drive ever gets corrupted, which is terrible. I have made a few noted tomyself regarding online storage solutions. I browsed around for a good few weeks alsolooking for a good enough note taking application that I wanted to use for work, my websitedesign and coding projects. I found it hard looking for a good note taking application that Icould use comfortably, I did try quite a few of them including google keep and notion none ofthese I enjoyed using.  So What I have been doing these last few days instead of working onthe website and the Projects that I have up. I have been moving all of my notes files andother documentation that I have onto Google Drive as a off site backup. Now I use a portablehard drive for storing my projects but for these blog posts and my system backups I amgoing to be using drive for the future to come.

      <h3> Other Plans </h3>
      <p>
        I maybe moving out, again. I am looking at a apartment future down the valley, still closeenough up this end in order for me to get to work with no issue. So this place is massive andshould be a good home for me and my family. I am looking forward to moving out anddecorating this place. I may just use my laptop more frequently rather than set up mydesktop in the place yet. I am trying to learn to cook a bit better also.
