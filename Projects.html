							<h3>This Website.</h3>
								<h5 align="right">08/09/17</h5>
								<p>
										This has been a project that I have been working on for a couple of
										weeks now, I haven't spoken much about it at all. So this started
										off as a small college project for a website design class then I
										sort of really enjoyed the theme/template that I designed and thought
										that it would look pretty awesome as a plain text website.
								</p>
								<p>
										The reason I have choosen to make this a simple plain text website rather
										than the website that are filled with java scripts, annoying trackers
										and those god damn advertisments. So something simple and easy enough to
										edit on a daily basis was needed. I made sure to make my code easy to follow
										on this site so if you want to check that out then press you f12 button and
										have a little look. I will post some source code here on this small page,
										with a up to date verison of the file layout. So what I am doing with this page of my
										website is just going to upload all of the source files for you guys to check out and
										download yourself.
