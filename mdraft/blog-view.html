          <p>
										This has been a project that I have been working on for a couple of
										weeks now, I haven't spoken much about it at all. So this started
										off as a small college project for a website design class then I
										sort of really enjoyed the theme/template that I designed and thought
										that it would look pretty awesome as a plain text website.
								</p>
								<p>
										The reason I have choosen to make this a simple plain text website rather
										than the website that are filled with java scripts, annoying trackers
										and those god damn advertisments. So something simple and easy enough to
										edit on a daily basis was needed. I made sure to make my code easy to follow
										on this site so if you want to check that out then press you f12 button and
										have a little look. I will post some source code here on this small page,
										with a up to date verison of the file layout. So what I am doing with this page of my
										website is just going to upload all of the source files for you guys to check out and
										download yourself.

              <h2> Mobile Website </h2>
              <div class="blog-content">
                <p>
                  This is just a small part of the website that I Have been working on for the last few days. I have been coding this all inside atom and the base of the site is a template that I found by a fellow coder on his website. So, after coding my part of the mobile website is happily finished for now, but implementing this into the desktop site in a way that is somewhat automatic. The solution that I have found is using a bit of JavaScript code for a sort of re-direct if you are on a mobile device. If I was to edit the site in the future I made it so that the script will find out if you are running android or IOS on your device so if I wanted to make two different sites for each operating system then I could.

I think that design is a big feature for a mobile website, and thatâ€™s what I wanted to do. I would like to make this website on of the biggest feature of my website due to the fact most people are browsing the internet on their mobile devices.
