arcade to play video games. While doing this there was a huge social element in this. The majority of these

          <p>
											The development of a huge ever-growing group isn't just going to be a short and sweet one, let
me tell you with more and more big name developers getting behind the open source
community, major things are going to come out. You may not even know that your devices is
running on open source software. Things like Android and some popular laptops are running on
open source operating systems.<br><br>
