              <p>
                This is one of the first ever Apple events that I was fully prepared, even though I did have a bit of trouble at the start because I was using a Linux machine none of the browsers that I had on there was not supported. So, I ended up watching the whole keynote on my new laptop. I took most of the notes for this blog post on my personal computer though. I do think that apple have really done good with this keynote compared their other keynotes that I have followed through before.
              </p>
              <h5>Apple TV</h5>
              <p>
                I came into this apple event with expecting some small features and the announcement of three new phones but I was blown away with new apple tv and the new features that come with one of the newer apple watches. I am thinking of getting one of the new apple tv 4k for my home set up and just need to get a 4k tv for my room before putting that in there. I think that most of the newer features on the tv is cool and am quite impressed with apple. I never used to be interested in the apple TV I just thought that it was something that I would buy and would never use like the amazon fire stick or the google chrome cast, but the newer apple tv introduces features that I think are useful and here is just a small list of them.
                <br>4k
                <br>Simple gamming feaatures
                <br>new A10X chip
                <br>Siri Remote
              </p>
              <h5> Apple Watch </h5>
              <p>
                If I am quite honest I am not really a smart watch person at all. I do own a smart watch but I do not wear as often as I should.  I have been trying to wear it but it is just one thing like me forgetting to charge it and the watch dyeing on my and after that I just won’t use it.
  But besides that, I am happy with the number of features that apple has released with the new apple watch. I have basically while watching the key note rote down in order things that I was interested in. But be aware this is a very rough list most of the spelling is incorrect and information like the price is not in the correct format.
              </p>
              <h5> iPhones... </h5>
              <p>
                Right, lets get one thing clear. I am an Android fan but I do use a launcher that does not have a app draw. In terms of the design and the build of the devices that run their horrible operating system I love it, and that goes for their newer models also. That doesn’t mean there aren’t features that I think should not be included. I have a few gripes that I need to iron out, like the AR features that I just think is a shitty gimmick. If I do agree with one thing though I agree with Apple removing the home button off their phone. I think that a truly gesture based OS would be amazing. I have a few gestures that I have enabled in the settings on my phone. Some are quick and simple like swipe up to launcher twitter and swipe down to bring me to all my messages.

            <div class="blog-content">
              <p>
                So it has been a while since I have done one of these to be quite honest, but today was a pretty eventful day that I think that I can talk about with you guys. I woke up this morning to find that I got my pay in my bank, and if there is one thing you must know about me is that I am not a huge spender at all, I still have the majority of my last month’s pay.  I decided to splurge a bit and go and get myself a awesome new tattoo and even a new laptop for my university course.
              </p>
              <p>
      My tattoo I love! I wanted something unique on my arm to start off my sleeve and I don’t think that I could have picked a better design myself. This is not a tattoo that I got just for the sake of getting there is a bit of a story behind it. I used to stay over my great nans when I was little and she would look after me for most of the week, I mean she was amazing she loved spending time with me and my brother watching WWE even though I don’t think she liked the show herself she would sit through it to spend some time with us. She would try and find some entertaining things to do with us. One of her favourite things to do was watch some of the birds out in the garden. She would even teach me the different types of birds, so I made her a little gift which she could use in her back garden. It was a little bird house that she could fill up with seeds to spot more birds in her garden. I sort of remember that about her and after she passed away we was all devastated so I have now got a nice tattoo to remember my great nan by.
      </p>
      <p>
      The next thing that I got today was a new laptop for my university work that I will be doing soon. I recently enrolled on my university course and am working at least in this photo on a new website to host all my programs and projects that I do. I will be starting my new year of university on the 25th of this month. I can honestly say that I am kind of excited to get back there.  In terms of the laptop, I can say it is one of the best laptops that I have ever owned and it is amazing even though it is only a i3 7th gen processor. It is more than enough for me.  I have been using this laptop for a couple of days now before college just set up all my file system for my course files. I am now looking at my website design projects and thinking of setting up my ideal work environment for optimal productivity. The only thing that I am missing is the fact I use to be running Linux rather than windows but all of my other computers are either based on Linux mint or elementary OS which are both amazing operating systems, but Windows 10 will be on the computers in my university. So, to keep a complete unified experience I will be keeping windows on here for the time being. I have added a few pieces of software that I need for college on this laptop though so a small list of software that is currently installed will be below.
              </p>
              <h5>Opera</h5>
              <p>
                I much prefer this over chrome due to the fact of the social implementation of my favourite applications like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger. I mean messenger I use personally to keep in touch with people but WhatsApp is what I use for work and need it always of the day.
              </p>
              <h5>Office 365</h5>
              <p>
                Need this for my university class. Will be using this to type up my assignments.
              </p>
              <h5>Teamknow How Cloud Storage</h5>
              <p>
                This is a amazing tool that basically the sort of cloud storage that I use on a day to day basis. It is a company that I currently work with that offer their 5year cloud which for the raw amount of storage that you get with it is amazing. I purchased this with the laptop and it is something like £90 for 2TB of storage for 5years. Enough said.
              </p>
              <h5>NotePade++ & Atom.io</h5>
              <p>
                Right I will talk about these two together because I basically use them for the same thing and that is some small coding projects. Last year I was making a password management tool in python. So when I was in college I had a small python program to run and get my randomly generated passwords and change them if needs be. Now this month I am working on a new website re-design.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Other than those pieces of software I do not use anything else so this is quite a light piece of work. Since I mainly will be writing up some assignments on this and editing some HTML and CSS scripts. I mean yeah, I could of got a small cheap HP and chucked a version of elementary OS on there and use that fine but I could not find one with the specifications that I wanted for a decent price. I was basically looking for a small compact machine with more than 2GB or ram and a SSD. That was all the specifications that I gave to the sales person who served me at my work in the computer store.

      				My progress with my latest project just shows how little time I have to work on things like this. It has taken me near enough around a week to get this close completing the new design but I am no wear near doing that. I have stared to take notes while I make my projects anyway, but I really want to be able to show these notes to people, and my idea for this site is to have live notes. Some where I in theory can go and post each one of my website design notes, with the implementation of comments. Yes comments full conversation on my ideas and a place where I can discuss features and design elements I am thinking about implementing.
      <br><br>
      Other things that I am working on is m new i3wm set up. I ave pulled out my old HP all-in-one PC out and dusted it of to install and try and learn i3 windows manager, which in simple terms is a windows manager that primarily uses the keyboard for navigations and re-sizing etc. I am currently using this set up while typing this blog post I mean I can mutter my way around to windows manager but for me to truly get to grips with it I may have to go deep into the "config" file and mess with the bindings a little. I really like when little things like this offer you to fully configure it your self and customize it to the users specification. I mean the user is in-control with this software. Also decision time. I have a short amount of time to make a quick decision on weather or not to go back to university and get my foundation degree.Oh shit! and death note live action TV series is out on Netflix. Fuck yes! Ah I have so much to do. Right time to get this shit done, I have organized my next few weeks out to sort out my student finance, my tattoo, the equipment, my rota for next week and this website design project that I am currently working on so there is a lot on at the moment.
      <br><br>
      I have been currently organizing my families mobile phone situation at the moment too, and it kinda frustrates me that they are all god damn IPhone users. I have nothing against apple, BUT!... their software "IOS" is such a pain to work with when trying to a small data transfer between phones. I mean like I literally hate using it. such a nice design piece of software but if your trying to use a different phone such as a android device they make it so hard! I am not using this post to rant about apple because I have done that before. I just would not recommend it to anyone.
      <br><br>
      Go with a Samsung!
      <br><br>
      Right this little part is where I talk about what I am currently working on, this is one of my favourite part so I can tell you guys some extremely exciting news. I am taking up another project, but this one is going to be different. I am currently got my new website re-design in front of me. It is still a work in progress, right now it is just the base HTML and CSS code for the plain text website. It at the moment, and I hope to keep it that way is 100% responsive. I have been taking written notes on development of this project, which is different for me because I am use to keeping just a small list of things I need to do on google keep. Written notes that I am looking to upload to the website once I do publish it.
      <br><br>
      I need to start editing these posts in HTML rather than plain text it will just make it a lot more easier for my just to post it straight to my website. Just those small little things about creating a website I quite enjoy to be honest. I am for today anyway without internet so I am taking the time on my day off to get this blog post written up and slowly implement new features into my website. Small things like adding in time stamps onto my blog posts on the title screen.

      					I am currently using Linux mint and am looking to put my self out side of my comfort zone, so my plan is to change all of my default OS’s to the KDE neon distribution. and I guess you can say that I already have a crap ton of things to talk about with it.
      				</p>
      				<p>
      				This set up is amazing and a really polished over all experience. Linux usually gets its hiccups in terms of performance, but with this it is the total opposite. The design of the over all desktop and customization features gets a 10/10 from me already. I really do not like the colour scheme but with the GTK themes options I have customized it to my liking. From the image above you can see how I set it up. With KDE compared to Ubuntu you are getting a lot better desktop experience. The reason for that is, Ubuntu uses the unity 8 desktop and recently they have switched from that straight to GNOME. I do not mind GNOME but I do not like the default set up of it. With KDE it has way more options for colour customizability. I am looking at possibly getting a nice dock for the desktop.
      KDE NEON!!!
      Now this is definitely the 110% best version of the KDE desktop. I have tried Linux mint KDE version and still came straight back to this operating system. KDE neon uses Ubuntu long-term release as its base mainly for the amazing driver support. this is the main reason that I picked up this distribution to support and breath new life into my work and blogging laptop. I am using HP stream device and trying to find a WIFI driver for it is really difficult. trust me

            <div class="blog-content">
              <p>
      				First off to clear the air. I am not a IPad, or even a Apple user. I am more a linux user, or possibly windows. My use would be geared towards a more open source user compared to the Adobe or Microsoft office user.
      I have owned a IPad my self but it was a regular IPad and not the “Pro” series. The reason I separate these, is because that they, in my opinion is gear towards two totally different users. The pro line up is called pro because it is more for the office users and I see it this way because of the features it comes with. The bigger screen and the options to have a keyboard cover for someone who will be doing a word processing, general office work. Apple decided to add in the option to add on the pencil witch widens the gap that apple is trying to wedge its self into. But the pencil is its own product and is just a additional add on to the ipad. The smart keyboard in most stores is shown with the ipad together.
