            I am here to show you what I am feeling and thinking through this blog. I am using Tumblr as the blogging platform of choice but soon I will be switching over and implementing my blogs in to this website. I will then be able to sort and list them as I please and possibly making working on them a bit more efficient.

          <p>So, The UK as a whole is under a complete lockdown after everything with the virus. Since the first death of the virus is 16 days ago I believe these measures could have been brought in sooner. I still believe that the virus will still continue to spread as more and more people will ignore these rules put in place. Last weekend alone hundreds of brits despite being told to stay inside, went down to barry island. Although people panic buying is slowing down a bit. All unessential establishments will be closed down for the foreseeable future...</p>

          <p>The measures that the UK Government is taking to tackle this global pandemic is not drastic enough to reduce the spread of this virus. Some of these measures include isolating your self from the world for a week or more? I currently have colleagues coming into the workplace showing symptoms and continue to work because they can not afford to take the time off work. The SSP is not enough to survive on considering some are being told to isolate themself for twelve weeks at a time...</p>

            <p>
              Yes, I have named my road bike. I use it every day. So why not? Now I have already written a long winded blogpoast about this bike.
              So if you would like to read that just <a id="a" href="https://morgandark21798.blogspot.com/2019/12/let-me-introduce-geoffrey.html">click here</a>. Now I have been on this bike and riding it since 2016, I have had some falls so it has some scuffs. Which is Okay. My plan for this small part of the website
              is to both plan and chart this what purchases/upgrade and any future plans I have for this bike.
