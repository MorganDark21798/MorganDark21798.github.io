<p><b> THIS WEBSITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! </b></p>
<br>
<p> I am here to show you what I am feeling and thinking through this blog. I am using Tumblr as the blogging platform of choice but soon I will be switching over and implementing my blogs in to this website. I will then be able to sort and list them as I please and possibly making working on them a bit more efficient.</p>
<p> I am breaking down my website slowly this is a make shift website while I work on my current Projects.</p>
