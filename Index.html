				<h2> MISS MASH </h2>
				<h4 align="right"> 27/08/17 </h4>
				<p>
				My progress with my latest project just shows how little time I have to work on things like this. It has taken me near enough around a week to get this close completing the new design but I am no wear near doing that. I have stared to take notes while I make my projects anyway, but I really want to be able to show these notes to people, and my idea for this site is to have live notes. Some where I in theory can go and post each one of my website design notes, with the implementation of comments. Yes comments full conversation on my ideas and a place where I can discuss features and design elements I am thinking about implementing.
<br><br>
Other things that I am working on is m new i3wm set up. I ave pulled out my old HP all-in-one PC out and dusted it of to install and try and learn i3 windows manager, which in simple terms is a windows manager that primarily uses the keyboard for navigations and re-sizing etc. I am currently using this set up while typing this blog post I mean I can mutter my way around to windows manager but for me to truly get to grips with it I may have to go deep into the "config" file and mess with the bindings a little. I really like when little things like this offer you to fully configure it your self and customize it to the users specification. I mean the user is in-control with this software. Also decision time. I have a short amount of time to make a quick decision on weather or not to go back to university and get my foundation degree.Oh shit! and death note live action TV series is out on Netflix. Fuck yes! Ah I have so much to do. Right time to get this shit done, I have organized my next few weeks out to sort out my student finance, my tattoo, the equipment, my rota for next week and this website design project that I am currently working on so there is a lot on at the moment.
<br><br>
I have been currently organizing my families mobile phone situation at the moment too, and it kinda frustrates me that they are all god damn IPhone users. I have nothing against apple, BUT!... their software "IOS" is such a pain to work with when trying to a small data transfer between phones. I mean like I literally hate using it. such a nice design piece of software but if your trying to use a different phone such as a android device they make it so hard! I am not using this post to rant about apple because I have done that before. I just would not recommend it to anyone.
<br><br>
Go with a Samsung!
<br><br>
Right this little part is where I talk about what I am currently working on, this is one of my favourite part so I can tell you guys some extremely exciting news. I am taking up another project, but this one is going to be different. I am currently got my new website re-design in front of me. It is still a work in progress, right now it is just the base HTML and CSS code for the plain text website. It at the moment, and I hope to keep it that way is 100% responsive. I have been taking written notes on development of this project, which is different for me because I am use to keeping just a small list of things I need to do on google keep. Written notes that I am looking to upload to the website once I do publish it.
<br><br>
I need to start editing these posts in HTML rather than plain text it will just make it a lot more easier for my just to post it straight to my website. Just those small little things about creating a website I quite enjoy to be honest. I am for today anyway without internet so I am taking the time on my day off to get this blog post written up and slowly implement new features into my website. Small things like adding in time stamps onto my blog posts on the title screen.

				<h2> KDE desktop enviroment </h2>
				<h4 align="right"> 29/06/17 </h4>
				<p>
					I am currently using Linux mint and am looking to put my self out side of my comfort zone, so my plan is to change all of my default OS’s to the KDE neon distribution. and I guess you can say that I already have a crap ton of things to talk about with it.
				</p>
				<p>
				This set up is amazing and a really polished over all experience. Linux usually gets its hiccups in terms of performance, but with this it is the total opposite. The design of the over all desktop and customization features gets a 10/10 from me already. I really do not like the colour scheme but with the GTK themes options I have customized it to my liking. From the image above you can see how I set it up. With KDE compared to Ubuntu you are getting a lot better desktop experience. The reason for that is, Ubuntu uses the unity 8 desktop and recently they have switched from that straight to GNOME. I do not mind GNOME but I do not like the default set up of it. With KDE it has way more options for colour customizability. I am looking at possibly getting a nice dock for the desktop.
KDE NEON!!!
Now this is definitely the 110% best version of the KDE desktop. I have tried Linux mint KDE version and still came straight back to this operating system. KDE neon uses Ubuntu long-term release as its base mainly for the amazing driver support. this is the main reason that I picked up this distribution to support and breath new life into my work and blogging laptop. I am using HP stream device and trying to find a WIFI driver for it is really difficult. trust me

				<h2>IPads</h2>
				<h4 align="right"> 23/06/17 </h4>
				<p>
				First off to clear the air. I am not a IPad, or even a Apple user. I am more a linux user, or possibly windows. My use would be geared towards a more open source user compared to the Adobe or Microsoft office user.
I have owned a IPad my self but it was a regular IPad and not the “Pro” series. The reason I separate these, is because that they, in my opinion is gear towards two totally different users. The pro line up is called pro because it is more for the office users and I see it this way because of the features it comes with. The bigger screen and the options to have a keyboard cover for someone who will be doing a word processing, general office work. Apple decided to add in the option to add on the pencil witch widens the gap that apple is trying to wedge its self into. But the pencil is its own product and is just a additional add on to the ipad. The smart keyboard in most stores is shown with the ipad together.

				<h2> The fix up </h2>
				<h4 align="right"> 14/06/17 </h4>
				<P>
				Yes, I am looking at getting my hobbies back up. I have just fixed up my bike and am planning to do a nice long ride down to Cardiff queen street from where i live currently. This is around a 60 mile ride. I want to chuck my self in the deep end with most of my hobbies because I know I preform better under a lot of pressure.
I am currently under my probation stage of my job and this will last for around three weeks. I have not had a manager or the correct training for this sort of thing but for the current situation I am doing very well. I am 13/17 into my weekly target and I still have three more days until the week is up.
Gaming I need to get back into I have still been playing Over watch but more of a casual player compared to being extremely competitive. I have made sure to try and keep my self up to date with my favourite game though.
