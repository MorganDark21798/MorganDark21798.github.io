<p><b> THIS WEBSITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! </b></p>
<br>
<p> I am here to show you what I am feeling and thinking through this blog. I am using Tumblr as the blogging platform of choice but soon I will be switching over and implementing my blogs in to this website. I will then be able to sort and list them as I please and possibly making working on them a bit more efficient.</p>
<p> I am breaking down my website slowly this is a make shift website while I work on my current Projects.</p>

<br><br><b>Project Cars</b><br><br>

<Projects>
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/GX6EpXWPgwE4kgB6A"><b>Clio MK3 VVT 3 door Hatch-back  1.5l engine </b></a>
<p>At the moment I am not able to drive I only have a learners license, but yet I have owned this car for a year. I have been working on it slowly ready for the day that I pass my test. I have been restoring it to its near factory condition. </p>

<br><br><b>GitHub Projects</b><br><br>

<Projects>
<a href="https://github.com/MorganDark21798/MorganDark21798.github.io"><b>Personal website</b></a>
<p>So, this is my personal website that I have been working on for the last hour and a half. It's temporary. I have added the content from the old website that I would like to keep and the things that I didn't like have been deleted.</p>
</Projects>
<Projects>
<a href="https://github.com/MorganDark21798/Pass-Manager-python-script"><b>Password Manager Python Script</b></a>
<p>This is a small project that I am currently working on and that is a small password manager that is coded in Python. I learnt how to code in Python in college and haven't done it since so I wanted to get use out of that skill and attempt to see if I can make a good enough application that is coded in python.
